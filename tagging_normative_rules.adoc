== How to Tag Normative Rules in the ISA Manuals

The ISA manuals contain a mix of normative and informative (AKA non-normative) content.
We use AsciiDoctor's anchor facility to tag normative text which is extracted by tools
provided in the link:https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources[docs-resources GitHub repository]
to create machine-readable and human-readable representations of normative rules.

Normative rules should have unique, short names that are easy to put in testplans. They reference tags in the AsciiDoc source files. The tag name matches the rule name in simple 1-1 cases. The normative rules are curated on a per-document basis with a YAML file listing the rules, their tags, and a short summary. A tool in docs-resources ***give-name generates a JSON file containing all of the normative rules for the document with their tags, as well as a human-readable AsciiDoc table with the same information.

=== Naming Normative Rules

Names should be short, descriptive, and as consistent as possible.  Rules related to an instruction, CSR, or CSR field should start with the instruction, CSR, or filed name.  Dots in the instruction or CSR field are replaced with dashes to keep tools happy.

[options="header"]
|===
|Scenario|Format|Example
|Simple instruction|<instr>_op, <inst>_enc|add_op, c-add_op, add_enc
|Additional instruction rules|<instr>_<short-descriptor>|sll_op, sll_shamt_rv32, sll_shamt_rv64
|CSR|<csr>_sz, <csr>_acc, <csr>_mode, <csr>_op|mscratch_sz, mscratch_acc, mscratch_mode
|CSR bitfield|<csr>-field_sz, <csr>-field_acc, <csr>-field_op|mstatus-mpp_sz, mstatus-mpp_acc, mstatus-mpp_op
|Parameters|<PARAM>|PMP_GRANULARITY
|Categories|<category>_<short_description>|br_targ, ldst_ea, R-type_operands
|Extension|<ext>_<short-descrption>|Sv_bare, Sv48_gigapage, Sv57_terapage, pmp_addr_match
|===


There should be at least two normative rule (op & enc) per instruction, even if there is a single tag describing multiple instructions. inst_enc defines instruction type and op/func fields.

Each CSR should have at least the following rules:

* sz (size in bits)
* acc (rw, ro, ro-h, rw-r, rw-rh from UDB)
* mode (associated privilege mode)
* op (operation, optional for CSRs such as mscratch that do not affect system behavior)

Each CSR with bitfields should have at least the following rules for each field:

* sz (size in bits)
* acc (some fields like mstatus.SD may be read-only even if the overall CSR is read/write)
* op

Reserved instructions, CSR fields, etc. use _rsv suffix.

Each parameter name should exactly match the name in https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/tree/main/spec/std/isa/ext[UDB], including being in all caps.

=== Naming Normative Rule Tags

|Scenario|Format|Example
|1-1 rule to tag|norm:<rule-name>|norm:add_op
|1-many rule to tags|norm:<rule-name>_<modifier> or as needed|norm:lw_op_rv64i, ***
|many-1 rule to tag|norm:<rule1>_<rule2>... or as needed|norm:shamt_rv64
|1-1 parameter to tag|norm:<udb_param_name>|norm:PMP_GRANULARITY

=== Tagging Normative Rules in RISC-V International Standards

First, read the link:https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources/blob/main/normative-rules.md[How to Tag Normative Rules in RISC-V International Standards] for information that applies to all RISC-V International standards. This document provides information such as:

* What exactly is a "normative rule"?
* How does one add normative rule tags to the AsciiDoc files using the AsciiDoc anchor facility?
* Ins and outs and gotchas when using the AsciiDoc anchor facility.
* How are the normative rules extracted from the AsciiDoc files?

=== Tagging Normative Rules in ISA Manuals

Now that you've read link:https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources/blob/normative-rules.md[How to Tag Normative Rules in RISC-V International Standards], here's some information specific to tagging normative rules
in the ISA manuals.

The ISA manual builds upon the anchor naming convention of a "norm:" prefix by following it with a name.  If there is a 1:1 relationship between the rule and the tag (the common case), then the name is simply the rule name.  If there is a many:1 or 1:many relationship, then see examples below.

=== Normative Rule Curation

Every normative rule is associated with one ratified specification document, such as a chapter of an ISA manual or a profile.  The normative rule may relate to more than one document but it must always have one primary document.  The normative rule is curated in a YAML file associated with the primary document.

Each specification AsciiDoc file has a corresponding YAML file listing ("curating") the normative rules primarily associated with that specification.  For example, the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/rv64.adoc[rv64.adoc] chapter of the Unprivileged ISA Manual has a corresponding rv64.yaml file in normative_rules.

The YAML file lists all of the normative rules contained in that document.  Each rule must have a rule name and a list of one or more tags.  It should have a short summary.  https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db[UDB] contains additional metadata and a pointer to the normative rule name, so the rule does not attempt to duplicate complex metadata already captured in UDB.  The form of the YAML is:

.rv64.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
$schema: "normative_rules_schema.json#"

normative_curations:
  # 1-to-1 rule to tag
  - name: rv64_x_sz
    summary: XLEN=64
    tags: ["norm:rv64_x_sz"]
  # many-to-1 rules to tag
  - names: [sll_shamt_rv64, srl_shamt_rv64, sra_shamt_rv64]
    tags: norm:shamt_rv64
  # 1-to-many rule to tags where multiple tags are needed to create a complete self-contained rule
  - name: lh_rv64i_op
    summary: lh 64-bit sign extension
    tags:["norm:lw_rv64i_op", "norm:subword_rv64i_load"]
  # another 1-to-many rule to tags where multiple tags are needed to create a complete self-contained rule
  - name: lhu_rv64i_op
    summary: lhu 64-bit zero extension
    tags:["norm:lw_rv64i_op", "norm:lwu_rv64i_op", "norm:subword_rv64i_load"]
----

These rules reference the following tags in the AsciiDoc:

.rv64.adoc
[source,adoc]
----
[[norm:rv64_x_sz]]
RV64I widens the integer registers and supported user address space to
64 bits (XLEN=64 in <<gprs>>).

SLL, SRL, and SRA perform logical left, logical right, and arithmetic
right shifts on the value in register _rs1_ by the shift amount held in
register _rs2_. [#norm:shamt_rv64]#In RV64I, only the low 6 bits of _rs2_ are considered
for the shift amount.#

[#norm:lw_rv64i_op]#The LW instruction loads a 32-bit value from memory and sign-extends
this to 64 bits before storing it in register _rd_ for RV64I.#
[#norm:lwu_rv64i_op]#The LWU instruction, on the other hand, zero-extends the 32-bit value from
memory for RV64I.# [#norm:subword_rv64i_load]#LH and LHU are defined analogously for 16-bit values, as are LB and LBU for 8-bit values.#
----

From the normative curation, a tool ***name] in docs-resources generates a JSON file containing all of the normative rules for the document with their tags, as well as a human-readable AsciiDoc table with the same information.
